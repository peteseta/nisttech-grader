// TODO: For all users, get their total score and rank them. Can have a nice podium for top 3
// TODO: Can also add a section for the problem breakdown. like for each problem, how many people solved it, how many people attempted it, etc.
// don't forget, since this is sveltekit we do database stuff in /src/routes/leaderboard/+page.server.js. see docs.
